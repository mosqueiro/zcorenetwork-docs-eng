## The ZCN Network Validator System 🌐

The ZCN Network of ZCore Network offers an innovative validation system 🚀, combining the reliability of blockchain technology with the uniqueness of NFTs.

### Limitation and Representation of Validators 🔒

With a strategic limit of 40 validators, the ZCN network ensures a balanced distribution of validation power. These validators are embodied by "ZCN Validators" NFTs, promoting a fair and controlled governance system.

### Requirements to Be a Validator 🛠️

To become a validator on the ZCN Network, it is necessary:

* **Validator NFT:** Own an NFT from the ZCN Validators collection.
* **ZCR Stake:** Make a minimum stake of 10 million ZCR.
* **Technical Infrastructure:** Maintain an active VPS (Virtual Private Server) with the validation software.

### Reward Mechanics and Validation Process 💰

Validators are rewarded for each validated block, following a queue system that ensures an equitable distribution of rewards. In addition, validators also receive 1% of ZCR sales on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), providing an additional income stream both on the BSC network and on the ZCN network.

### Acquiring a Validator NFT 🛒

Those interested in acquiring a Validator NFT and joining the exclusive group of ZCN validators should contact the ZCore team by email: [info@zcore.network](mailto:info@zcore.network).

### Conclusion ✨

The validator system of the ZCN Network is a perfect harmony of innovation and blockchain technology, creating a secure and efficient environment. The integration of NFTs brings a unique element and provides a robust validation system. With the advantage of earnings on the ZCN network and participation in sales on the BSC, validators play a vital role in sustaining the integrity and advancing the ZCore ecosystem. 🌟
