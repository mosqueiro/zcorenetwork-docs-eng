### Introduction to Staking üå±

Staking is an effective way for cryptocurrency holders to increase their assets by locking coins in a wallet to participate in the operations of a blockchain network. With ZCRAI Solana, you can start with Liquidity Pools (LP) staking and, later on, NFT staking as the roadmap progresses.

### ZCRAI/SOL LP Staking ü§ù

To participate in LP staking, users must set up a liquidity pair of ZCRAI and SOL. The staking yields are distributed in ZCRAI tokens.

#### How to Set Up ZCRAI/SOL LP

1.

2. Follow the instructions to add liquidity to the ZCRAI and SOL pool, without worrying about ranges; the standard LP type is straightforward, you just create the LP and deposit it in the staking pool.
