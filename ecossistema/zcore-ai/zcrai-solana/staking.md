### Introduction to Staking üå±

Staking is an effective way for cryptocurrency holders to increase their assets by locking coins in a wallet to participate in a blockchain network's operations. With ZCRAI Solana, you can start with Liquidity Pools (LP) staking and, in the future, NFT staking as the roadmap progresses.

### ZCRAI/SOL LP Staking ü§ù

To participate in LP staking, users must set up a ZCRAI and SOL liquidity pair. Staking yields are distributed in ZCRAI tokens.

#### How to Set Up ZCRAI/SOL LP

2. Follow the instructions to add liquidity to the ZCRAI and SOL pool, without worrying about ranges; the standard LP type is straightforward, you just create the LP and deposit it in the staking pool.
3. After adding liquidity, you will receive LP tokens that symbolize your share in the pool.
