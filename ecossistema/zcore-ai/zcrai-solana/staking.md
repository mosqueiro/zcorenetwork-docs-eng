### Introduction to Staking üå±

Staking is an effective way for cryptocurrency holders to increase their assets by locking coins in a wallet to participate in the operations of a blockchain network. With ZCRAI Solana, you can start with Liquidity Pools (LP) staking and, later on, NFT staking as the roadmap progresses.

### ZCRAI/SOL LP Staking ü§ù

To participate in LP staking, users must set up a liquidity pair of ZCRAI and SOL. The staking yields are distributed in ZCRAI tokens.
