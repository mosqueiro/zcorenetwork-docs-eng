# Anti-Money Laundering Policy

### Introduction <a href="#introdu-o" id="introdu-o"></a>

ZCore recognizes the importance of combating money laundering and other illicit activities, especially in centralized transactions. This policy applies to Pix movements, which are transactions involving the exchange of tokens for money or money for tokens, passing through the ZCore Network. It is important to note that transactions carried out through the wallet are decentralized and are not subject to this policy, as they do not pass through the ZCore Network.
