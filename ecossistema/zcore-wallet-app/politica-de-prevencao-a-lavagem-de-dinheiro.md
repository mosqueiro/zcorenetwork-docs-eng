# Anti-Money Laundering Policy

### Introduction <a href="#introdu-o" id="introdu-o"></a>

ZCore recognizes the importance of combating money laundering and other illicit activities, especially in centralized transactions. This policy applies to Pix transactions, which involve the exchange of tokens for money or money for tokens, through the ZCore Network. It is important to note that transactions made through the wallet are decentralized and are not subject to this policy, as they do not go through the ZCore Network.
