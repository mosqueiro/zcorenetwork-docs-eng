# 🔐 Staking

Staking ZCR allows you to receive rewards in USDT, coming from 1.0% ZCR reflections, which means users do not receive ZCR and no new ZCR tokens are created. This approach ensures that ZCR does not become inflationary, as there is no additional token issuance. The total amount of ZCR was set at 2.5 billion from the start. You can participate in staking by visiting the website below or directly through the ZCore Wallet app:
