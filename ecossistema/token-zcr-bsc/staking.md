# 🔐 Staking

ZCR staking allows for the receipt of rewards in USDT, coming from the reflections of 1.0% of ZCR, which means that users do not receive ZCR and new ZCR tokens are not created. This approach ensures that ZCR does not become inflationary, as there is no additional token issuance. The total amount of ZCR has been fixed at 2.5 billion since the beginning. You can participate in staking by accessing the website below or directly through the ZCore Wallet app:
