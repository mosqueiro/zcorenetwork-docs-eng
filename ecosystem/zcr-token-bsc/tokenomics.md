## Burns

> :fire: ZCR burns, essential to its operation, are carried out through the ZCN network and the ZCore AI platform. Unlike conventional practices, these native burns decrease the total supply directly, without the need to transfer to a specific burn address. This method ensures a more accurate representation of the token's market cap. With the continuous reduction of the total supply, ZCR becomes a deflationary token, which potentially increases its value due to increasing scarcity in the market.
