# ðŸª™ ZCR Token (BSC)

The ZCR token created on the BSC network will have a bridge with the ZCN network where it is the standard token, to allow seamless interoperability between the two ecosystems. The bridge mechanism will enable the exchange of the ZCR token on the BSC for its ZCN equivalent and vice versa. This integration creates new opportunities for users to participate in various DeFi applications and games using the same currency, in addition to enhancing the liquidity and accessibility of the ZCR token. You can get ahead and buy it now, and even earn staking rewards before the mainnet launch.
