**Introduction to ZCore Network's ZCN EVM Network**

We are excited to introduce the ZCN EVM Network from ZCore Network, a significant advancement in our blockchain infrastructure, with a planned launch in February 2024. This network represents a milestone in ZCore's evolution, strengthening our position in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

**Network Development and Testing**

The development of the ZCN Network has been successfully completed, and it is currently in the testing phase on our testnet. This allows developers and users to experience the network in a controlled environment, ensuring stability and security before the official launch.

**Integration with ZCR Token**

One of the most notable features of the ZCN Network is the integration with the ZCR token of the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) network. ZCR tokens will be able to be transferred to the ZCN Network through a dedicated bridge, making ZCR the native currency of the ZCN Network. In addition, the tokens can be transferred back to the BSC network, keeping the total ZCR supply constant at 2.5 billion. This interoperability reinforces the flexibility and liquidity of ZCR, expanding its reach and applicability.

**Utility and Value of ZCR on the ZCN Network**

On the ZCN Network, all transactions are processed using ZCR, which gives greater value and utility to the ZCore currency. This not only strengthens ZCR's position in the market, but also encourages its active use within the ZCore ecosystem.

**Compatibility with Smart Contracts and Tools**

A crucial aspect of the ZCN Network is its compatibility with smart contracts and tools from the Ethereum and BSC networks. This means that developers and users who are already familiar with these platforms can easily migrate or expand their operations to the ZCN Network, taking advantage of the efficiency and advanced features it offers.

**Integration with ZCore Wallet App**

The ZCN Network will also be integrated into the ZCore Wallet app. This integration will simplify access to the network, promoting broader adoption and facilitating daily use. With this implementation, the ZCore Network not only expands its technological reach, but also strives to make the user experience more fluid and accessible.

**Conclusion**

The ZCore Network's ZCN EVM Network is a significant step forward in our mission to provide a robust, flexible, and easy-to-use blockchain platform. With its integration with ZCR, compatibility with other leading networks, and ease of use through the ZCore Wallet, the ZCN Network is ready to be an innovative force in the cryptocurrency universe. We invite our community to actively participate in this exciting journey towards the future of blockchain technology.
