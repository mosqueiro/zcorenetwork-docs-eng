**The ZCN Network Validator System**

The ZCN Network of ZCore Network presents an innovative validation system, based on an exclusive model that integrates NFT technology with blockchain validation mechanics. This system is crucial to maintaining the security and efficiency of the network.

**Limitation and Representation of Validators**

The ZCN network imposes a strict limit of 40 validators. These validators are represented by a unique collection of NFTs, called "ZCN Validators". This approach ensures an equitable and controlled distribution of validation power in the network.

**Requirements to Be a Validator**

To become a validator on the ZCN Network, three main components are required:

1. **Validator NFT**: Each validator must own an NFT from the ZCN Validators collection.
2. **ZCR Stake**: A stake of 10 million ZCR is required to qualify as a validator.
3. **Technical Infrastructure**: Validators need to operate a VPS (Virtual Private Server) running the specific validation software.

**Reward Mechanics and Validation Process**

In the ZCN Network, validators are rewarded for each block discovered. The process follows a queue system, where each validator receives the reward for blocks discovered in sequence. This mechanic ensures a fair and systematic distribution of rewards. Interested parties can observe this process in action on the network's testnet.

**Issuance and Availability of Validator NFTs**

So far, 29 of the 40 Validator NFTs have already been issued, leaving only 11 available. This scarcity highlights the exclusivity and value of these NFTs in the ZCN ecosystem.

**Acquiring a Validator NFT**

To acquire a Validator NFT, users must first mint an NFT from the Farm Horses collection. Within this collection, Legendary NFTs are the only ones that grant the right to a Validator NFT. The remaining Legendary NFTs are randomly distributed in the Farm Horses collection, adding an element of surprise and opportunity in the quest to become a validator on the ZCN Network.

**Conclusion**

The validator system of the ZCN Network is a notable example of how innovation and blockchain technology can be harmonized to create a secure, fair, and efficient ecosystem. The integration of NFTs into this process not only adds a unique aspect of collectability but also ensures a robust and reliable validation system for the ZCN network. As the network continues to grow and develop, validators will play a crucial role in maintaining integrity and advancing the ZCore ecosystem.
