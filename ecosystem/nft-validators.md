**Acquisition of NFT Validators: The Path Through Legendary NFTs**

To become a holder of an NFT Validator, it is essential to first own a legendary ZCore NFT. This prerequisite ensures that only the most committed and dedicated participants have the opportunity to acquire an NFT Validator. Each legendary NFT is eligible to be exchanged for an NFT Validator, establishing an exclusive and valuable path for cryptocurrency enthusiasts.

**Privileges and Benefits of NFT Validators Holders**

Once an individual becomes a holder of an NFT Validator, they gain the power to validate transactions on the ZCore Network (ZCN). This crucial responsibility not only maintains the integrity and security of the network but also allows holders to receive all fees associated with validated transactions.

In addition, NFT Validators holders are benefited with a passive income of 1.5% from ZCore (ZCR) reflections on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) network. This reflection mechanism ensures that NFT Validators holders are continuously rewarded for their crucial role in the network, providing an additional income stream and encouraging long-term participation.
