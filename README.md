# â„¹ About ZCore

ZCore has been present in the market since 2015, dedicating itself to the construction of innovations derived from blockchain technology. In our portfolio, the following solutions and technological advances stand out:

* NFT Collection (link to the NFT topic)

In the "Farm Horse" collection, the validators and delegators of the POSDAO system are present, playing a crucial role in the governance of the ZCore structure. The "horses" allow their holders to become validators and delegators on the ZCore Network, providing earnings through staking in ZCR and USDT. In addition, they are responsible for participating in votes in the ecosystem, an example is the NFT Arts IA championship that also obtains participation in the profits from minting NFT on the platform and enjoying exclusive participation in the ZCore City Metaverse.
